For the second time, the GAMA Days 2022 will bring together users and developers from around the world in an online conference. After the success of the first GAMA Days last year, we are looking forward to continue the exchange. We invite platform (or plug-in) developers to present their latest creations and users to show how they use the platform. These exchanges will help to further develop and structure the GAMA community.

## Vision of GAMA

Agent-based modeling is nowadays becoming increasingly popular for the study of complex systems. Nevertheless, its use requires significant computer programming work because it requires describing all agents and their behavior in the form of algorithms. The GAMA open-source platform aims to help modelers do this work. This generic platform, which has been developed since 2007 by a consortium of research teams allows the content of a model to be built using a modeling language that is easy to access and simulated. GAMA has experienced significant growth in recent years thanks to its ability to build and simulate large-scale models, including hundreds of thousands of agents and detailed geographic data. It also has advanced 3D visualization tools as well as tools dedicated to the construction of serious games. This platform is now used in many research projects dealing with issues as varied as epidemiology, land-use change, natural or technological risks, natural resource management, and urban mobility.

## Format of the GAMA Days 2022

It's all about networking and communication. To bring together a global community, we decided make the GAMA Days an online event. But hold on..! It's more than just a zoom meeting. We prepared everything to make communication work well in the virtual event.

* The conference will be hosted with Wonder.me. This meeting platform will allow social interactions, informal chats and spontaneous private meetings, almost as in a on-site conference
* Open Fora invite direct communication, collaboration and discussions between participants.
* Meet other users and chat to the developers in the virtual coffee breaks.
